 - What was novel in  McCulloch and Pitts’s paper was a theory that employed logic and
the mathematical notion of computation – introduced by Alan Turing (1936–37) in terms of what came to be known as Turing 
Machines – to explain how neural mechanisms might realize mental functions. [PIC04, p.175]
 - For instance, a common misconception is that McCulloch and Pitts demonstrated that neural nets could compute
anything that Turing Machines could [PIC04, p.175]
 - This brief passage is the only one mentioning computation. By stating
   that McCulloch–Pitts nets computed, this passage provided the first
   known published link between the mathematical theory of computation and brain theory. It was a pivotal statement in the history of
   computationalism.
   It is often said that McCulloch and Pitts proved that their nets can
   compute anything that Turing Machines can compute (e.g., Koch
   and Segev 2000). This misconception was propagated by McCulloch
   COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF MIND AND BRAIN 197
   himself. For instance, in summarizing the significance of their paper,
   McCulloch wrote to a colleague:
   [T]he original paper with Pitts entitled ‘‘A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in
   Nervous Activity’’ ... sets up a calculus of propositions subscripted for the time of
   their appearance for any net handling all-or-none signals, and shows that such nets
   can compute any computable number or, for that matter, do anything any other net
   can do by the way of pulling consequences out of premises.88  [PIC04, p.197-198]
 - But in discussing computation in their paper, McCulloch and Pitts
   did not prove any results about the computation power of their nets;
   they only stated that there were results to prove. And their conjecture
   was not that their nets can compute anything that can be computed
   by Turing Machines. Rather, they claimed that if their nets were
   provided with a tape, scanners, and ‘‘efferents,’’ then they would
   compute what Turing Machines could compute; without a tape,
   McCulloch and Pitts expected even nets with circles to compute a
   smaller class of functions than the class computable by Turing Machines.[PIC04, p.197-198]
 - s. As McCulloch explained a few years
   later, he and Pitts were interpreting neural inputs and outputs as if
   they were symbols written on the tape of a Turing Machine: What we thought we were doing (and I thought we succeeded fairly well) was
   treating the brain as a Turing machine... The important thing was, for us, that we
   had to take a logic and subscript it for the time of occurrence of a signal (which is, if
   you will, no more than a proposition on the move). This was needed in order to
   construct theory enough to be able to state how a nervous system could do anything.
   The delightful thing is that the very simplest set of appropriate assumptions is sufficient to show that a nervous system can compute any computable number. It is that
   kind of a device, if you like a Turing machine.90 [PIC04, p 190]
