 - Hebb erwähnt Neurobiotaxis - relevant im Bezug auf Verstärkung bzw. Lernen? [AR88 p.50]

  - "The assumption is, in brief, that a growth process accompanying synaptic activity makes the synapse more readily traversed." [AR88, p.49]
  
  - "We have already seen (in Chapter 1) that an "activity" trace can hardly accoutn for the permanence of early learning, but at the same time iny may account reverberatory activity as the explanation of other phenomena" [AR88, p.49]

  - "Let us assume then that the persistence or repetition of a reverbaratory activity (or "trace") tends to induce lasting cellular changes that add to its stability. The assumption can be precisely stated as follows: when an axion of call A is near enough to excite a cell B  and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, somme growth process of metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased" [AR88, p.50]

  - "The most obvious and I believe much the most probable suggestion cincerning the way in which one cell could become more capable of firing another is that synaptic knobs. develop and increase the area of contact  between the afferent axon and the efferent soma." [AR88, p.50]

  - "To make it more specific, I have chosen to assume that the growth of synaptic knobs, with or wothout neurobiotaxis, is the basis of the change of facilitation from one cell on another, and this is not altogether implausible. It hgas been demonstrated by Arvanitaki (1942) that a contiguity alone will permit the excitation aroused in one cell to be transmitted to another." [AR88, p.51]

  - "In short, its feasible to assume that synaptic knobs develop with neural activity and represent a lowered synaptic resistance." [AR88, p.51]

  - "The general idea is an old one, that any two cells or systems of cells that are repeatedly active at the same time will tend to become "associated", so that activity facilitates activity in the other" [AR88, p.52]

  - "[...] in the presence of alternate pathways each having the same function, so that brain damage might remove some pathways without preventing the system from functioning, particulalry if the system has been long established, with well developed synaptic knobs which decrease the number of fibers that must be active at one to traverse a synapse" [AR88, p.54]
