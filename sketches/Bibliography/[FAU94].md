 - We shall take the view that neural nets are basically mathematical models of information processing. [FAU97, p.2]
 - biologische neuronale Netze sind die Inspirationsgrundlage für künstliche neuronale Netze, oder "Neurocomputing"

 - computationally optimal groupings of artificial neurons correspond to biological bundles of neurons [FAU97, p.7]: Separating the action of a backpropagation net into smaller pieces to make it more local (and therefor, perhaps more biologically plausible) also allows improvement in computational power

- local backpropagation vs Backpropagation discussion on p. 316 ("Backpropagation lacks  biological plausibility") [FAU97, p.316]

- "The frequeny of of firing varies and can be viewed as a signal of either lesser or greater magnitude. This corresponds to to looking at discrete time steps and summing all activity (signals received or signals sent) at a particular point in time" [FAU97, p.5]
