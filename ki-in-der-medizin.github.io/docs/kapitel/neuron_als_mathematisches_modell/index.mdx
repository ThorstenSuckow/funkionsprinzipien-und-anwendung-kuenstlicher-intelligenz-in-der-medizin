 - Simple artificial neurons, such as the McCulloch–Pitts model, are sometimes described as "caricature models", since they are intended to reflect one or more neurophysiological observations, but without regard to realism.[3]
 - • Empirical Models, or caricature models, occur when one tries to construct a model reflecting one or more important neurophysiological
observations, often without regard to other neurophysiological facts.
Typical examples are the McCulloch-Pitts (1943) bistable neuron and
Hopfield's network (1982). Although amenable to mathematical analysis, these models have no rigorous connection with real neural systems [HI97, S.4, Abs. 1]

### Zitate

### McC16
> What is a number that a man may know it, and a man that he may know a number [McC61, S.7, Abs.3 ]

#### Arb 19
> Among the key players in these developments was the neurologist Warren Sturgis McCulloch (1898-
1968), whose formalization with Walter Pitts [2] of the brain as a network of neurons viewed as logical processing elements
was a key element in the definition of the classical computer architecture based on stored programs that was devised by
John von Neumann , and the cybernetics of Norbert Wiener. It also led (with the addition of learning rules built on the ideas
of Donald Hebb and Frank Rosenblatt) to the resurgence of artificial neural networks as a new computing technology from
the mid-1980s onwards, a resurgence coupled with that in the computational modeling of the brain, thus closing the circle
back to McCulloch’s original source of inspiration. [Arb19, "Introduction", S. 1]

> he [McCulloch] was
driven less by the demands of technology than the quest to understand how we think, with specific experimental
techniques being secondary to the basic questions: What is the logic of thought? What is a person? What is a man that he
may know a number? [Arb19, "Introduction", S. 1]

> set himself the goal of developing an experimental epistemology: how can one really
understand the mind in terms of the brain? More particularly, he sought to discover "The Logical Calculus Immanent in
Nervous Activity"  [Arb19, "Introduction", S. 1]

> On this basis Descartes elaborated the idea
that nerve fibers were hydraulic tubes, controlled by valves in the brain to carry commands down to the muscles, but that
inside this hydraulic tube there is a little string so that when the muscle had contracted sufficiently, it could pull the string
to signal back to the brain to close the valve. [...]  So already in his study of Descartes, McCulloch found some very
important ideas to feed into experimental epistemology.  [Arb19, "The Formative Years", S. 2, Abs. 3]

> As another stage in McCulloch's search for the logic of the nervous system, he began thinking about loops in the nervous
system. [...] which made explicit the possibility of loops in
the nervous system, an idea that today we take for granted. And " ... in spite of the busy life of the intern, I was forever
studying anything that might lead me to a theory of nervous function. My fellow intern, Samuel Bernard Wortis, accused me
of trying to write an equation for the working of the brain. I am still trying to!"[Arb19, S. 3, Abs. 2]

> Back to McCulloch's intellectual development during the research years at Yale. In addition to the work in functional
neuroanatomy, McCulloch was continuing to pursue philosophical questions, such as "What could be the logic of the
brain?" [Arb19, S.3, letzter Absatz]

> Still the question, of course, that really intrigued McCulloch was this: If we have in
Principia Mathematica an attempt to reduce all the complexity of number down to logical propositions, could one then see
how to map logical propositions into the brain? Fitch, who was the expert on mathematical logic at Yale at the time, was
not able to meet that challenge, but McCulloch kept analyzing layers of neurons, and kept worrying about loops in neurons
because he had not yet got the concept of delay – if you negate something as you go around the loop then the input must
equal its negation, and how can that be? [Arb19, S.4, Abs 1]

> The result of all this experience came to be a series of ten meetings set up by the Macy Foundation, and for which
McCulloch served as Chairman. The first five were not published, the last five were. They typified the successes as well as
the difficulties of the bringing together of biology and technology. Out of such interactions grew cybernetics – the study of
control and communication in animal and machine – which became officially christened when Wiener published his book of
that name in 1948, and which then gave its name to the last five of the Macy meetings (see, e.g., [20]). [...] the roster included not only McCulloch, Pitts, Wiener, and von Neumann, but also the anthropologists Margaret Mead and
Gregory Bateson; Claude Shannon (the father of information theory), Wolfgang Köhler (the gestalt psychologist), and
Heinrich Klüver (well known for the Klüver-Bucy syndrome, and for his book seeking to deduce brain mechanisms from the
effects of taking mescaline).  [Arb19, S.5, Abs 1]

> The result of this work, which also involved McCulloch and the Chilean
neuroanatomist Humberto Maturana and built on earlier insights of Hartline and Barlow, was the understanding that the
retina does not just relay information to the brain, but is already processing very subtle features of the visual input that
were, in some way, related to the ethology, the behavior, of the frog, with sets of these features sent in retinotopic layers
to the visual tectum of the midbrain. [Arb19, S. 6, Abs. 3]

>  Basically, McCulloch and Pitts proved that any finite-state control box for a Turing machine could
be replaced by a network of their formalized neurons. And so, in a way, one can say that Turing provided the "Psychology of
the Computable" whereas McCulloch and Pitts provided "The Physiology of the Computable".  [Arb19, S. 8, "A Selection of Key Papers", Abs. 2]

> This work together with that of Turing and others who charted "effective computability" laid the basis for the new field
of automata theory which found its first full expression in the 1956 book Automata Studies edited by Claude Shannon and
John McCarthy [31]. [Arb19, S. 8, "A Selection of Key Papers", Abs. 3]

> The 1943 paper is the most famous paper by McCulloch and Pitts, and has been incredibly influential, due to its basic
idea that, not to get too technical, given any "finite enough" specification of what is to be done, you can build a McCullochPitts network to do it. [Arb19, S. 11, "Does the Brain Have a Logic?", Abs. 1]

> In short, the 1943 paper has been incredibly influential in the history of computation and in the development of
connectionism. On the other hand, many a computational neuroscientist may lament the paper's simplicities [46] since
neurons have complex dendrites and neuromodulation and calcium channels and many other properties. But McCulloch
knew that. He never claimed that the 1943 model exhausted the richness of individual neurons, and even our brief sample
above shows that much of his later work was devoted to coming up with more subtle (but certainly not biophysical or
neurochemical) models of the neuron. Nonetheless, he and Pitts had shown that "anything finite enough" that could be
logically conceived could be done by a neural network. They had killed dualism! Until then, there was no convincing
argument for the idea that logical thought could be done by a brain since the working out of neurophysiological detail had
been mostly at the level of reflexes. Theirs is a tremendous achievement [Arb19, S. 11, "Does the Brain Have a Logic?", Abs. 4]

> In my opinion, these
"alogical" contributions have the most to say for the development of computational neuroscience, while the "logical
calculus" has the greater philosophical importance but has contributed more to computer science than to neuroscience. [Arb19, S. 12, Abs. 2]


#### Per88

> The most influential of McCulloch's papers is the
earliest in the compendium [Per88, "Logical Neurons and immanent ideas", S. 9]

> The effect of the 'immanent ideas' paper was
immediately to sweep aside these objections to the
possibility of a true science of the brain. If nerve cells
were equivalent to the formal neurons of McCulloch
and Pitts and if circuits of such elements could be
made arbitrarily complicated, then any kind of
animal behavior, however marvelously complicated
or however intricately linked to sensory input, could
be reproduced, and hence understood, in terms of
these circuits. [Per88, "Logical Neurons and immanent ideas", S. 9]

> Central to McCulloch's approach to the nervous
system was his claim that 'Pitts and I showed that
brains were Turing machines, and that any Turing
machine could be made out of neurons', and that
'the nervous system is par excellence a logical
machine'1. [Per88, "Perceptrons and connectionism", S. 10]

> Recent findings on neurons that do not
produce impulses33, on the detailed structure and
function of ion channels34, and on neuromodulation3sshow how little the formal neuron doesjustice
to the biological reality. [Per88, "Nerve cells and brains", S. 10]

> The decline
and long dormancy of Perceptron models of largescale neuronal circuits, which were the most direct
descendants of the McCulloch-Pitts neural networks, also reinforced such disillusion with theory [Per88, "Theoretical models in neurobiology", S. 11]



### 2.2 Das MCP-Neuron

Die Autoren beginnen das Paper mit der Aussage, daß, basierend auf dem "Alles-oder-nichts Gesetz" - Ereignisse von Nervenzellen und ihrer Beziehungen untereinander wie Aussagenlogik verstanden werden können.

I Introduction
In der Einführung gehen die Autoren auf das Zusammenspiel von Nervenzellen, Schwellenwerte und der Weiterleitung von Signalen ein. HIerbei machen sie noch einmal deutlich, welche Bedeutung der Schwellenwert hat, der durch die Nervenzelle selber festgelegt ist. Weiter schreiben Sie über die Hemmung anderer Nervenzelle, sobald eine Nervenzelle Signale weiterleitet: "Inhibition is the termination opf prevention of the activity of one group of neurons by concurrent or antecedent activity of a second group", was sich später auch bei [ROS57] wiederfindet, der die Rückkoppelung von R-Einheiten zu A-Einheiten beschreibt-

> The "all-or-none law" of nervous activity is sufficient to insure that the activity of any neuron may be represented as a proposition [CUL43, p100]
(bspw. Feuert Ja = 1, Nein = 0)

Weiter führen sie aus, daß die Verbindungen der NErvenzellen untereinander über Verbindungen der Aussagen modelliert werden können, wobei sie sagen, daß zu jeder Raktion eines Neurons eine  korrespondierende Behauptung einer einfachen Aussage. Die Konfiguration von den Synapsen (die leitfähigkeit, Anm Autor) und der Schwellwert  des Neuron sind hier in BEtracht zu ziehen.

Relative Inhibition: Eine hemmende Synapse verhindert nicht das Feuern eines Neurons, sondern erhöht nur den Schwellenwert, so daß mehr Neuronen feuern müssen, um über die Schwelle zu kommen

Im folgenden werden 10 Theoreme aufgestellt, für Netze mit und ohne Zyklen.

2. The Theory: Nets Without Circles
Im zweiten Kapitel stellen die Autoren für ihren Kalkül folgende pshysikalischen Annahmen:
1) Ein Neuron arbeitet auf Basis des Alles oder NIchts Gesetz
2) Eine bestimmte Nummer von Synapsen muß angeregt werden innerhalb einer bestimmten Periode  um ein Neuron erregen zu können
3) Die einzige signifikante VErzögerung bei der Signalübertragung innerhalb des Nervensystems ist bedingt durch Verzögerung der Synapse (Leitfähigkeit, Anm. des Autors)
4) Eine hemmende Synapse verhindert die Erregung eines Neurons
5) Die Struktur des Netwerks ändert sich nicht

3. Nets with Circles
In zyklischen Netzen nimmt die Komplexität zu, weil "This is alrgely a consequence of the possibility that activity may be set up in a circuit and continue reverberating around it for an indefinite period of time, so that the realizable **Pr** may involve reference to past events of an indefinite degree of remoteness" [CUL42, p108]

Am Ende dieses Kapitels knüpfen die Autoren ihre Aussage an Berechenbarkeit an: "if any number can be comouted by an organism, it is computable by these definitions, and conversely", wo zu [PIC04] feststellt:

> By stating that McCulloch–Pitts nets computed, this passage provided the first
known published link between the mathematical theory of computation and brain theory. It was a pivotal statement in the history of
computationalism. [PIC04, p. 197]
