  abstract = {Hebb's learning traces its origin in Pavlov's classical conditioning; however, while the former has been extensively modeled in the past decades (e.g., by the Hopfield model and countless variations on theme), as for the latter, modeling has remained largely unaddressed so far. Furthermore, a mathematical bridge connecting these two pillars is totally lacking. The main difficulty toward this goal lies in the intrinsically different scales of the information involved: Pavlov's theory is about correlations between concepts that are (dynamically) stored in the synaptic matrix as exemplified by the celebrated experiment starring a dog and a ringing bell; conversely, Hebb's theory is about correlations between pairs of neurons as summarized by the famous statement that neurons that fire together wire together. In this letter, we rely on stochastic process theory to prove that as long as we keep neurons' and synapses' timescales largely split, Pavlov's mechanism spontaneously takes place and ultimately gives rise to synaptic weights that recover the Hebbian kernel.}

  abstract = {The computational power of massively parallel networks of simple processing elements resides in the communication bandwidth provided by the hardware connections between elements. These connections can allow a significant fraction of the knowledge of the system to be applied to an instance of a problem in a very short time. One kind of computation for which massively parallel networks appear to be well suited is large constraint satisfaction searches, but to use the connections efficiently two conditions must be met: First, a search technique that is suitable for parallel networks must be found. Second, there must be some way of choosing internal representations which allow the preexisting hardware connections to be used efficiently for encoding the constraints in the domain being searched. We describe a general parallel search method, based on statistical mechanics, and we show how it leads to a general learning rule for modifying the connection strengths so as to incorporate knowledge about a task domain in an efficient way. We describe some simple examples in which the learning algorithm creates internal representations that are demonstrably the most efficient way of using the preexisting connectivity structure.},

  abstract = {Background: State-of-the-art classifiers based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were shown to classify images of skin cancer on par with dermatologists and could enable lifesaving and fast diagnoses, even outside the hospital via installation of apps on mobile devices. To our knowledge, at present there is no review of the current work in this research area. Objective: This study presents the first systematic review of the state-of-the-art research on classifying skin lesions with CNNs. We limit our review to skin lesion classifiers. In particular, methods that apply a CNN only for segmentation or for the classification of dermoscopic patterns are not considered here. Furthermore, this study discusses why the comparability of the presented procedures is very difficult and which challenges must be addressed in the future. Methods: We searched the Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases for systematic reviews and original research articles published in English. Only papers that reported sufficient scientific proceedings are included in this review. Results: We found 13 papers that classified skin lesions using CNNs. In principle, classification methods can be differentiated according to three principles. Approaches that use a CNN already trained by means of another large dataset and then optimize its parameters to the classification of skin lesions are the most common ones used and they display the best performance with the currently available limited datasets. Conclusions: CNNs display a high performance as state-of-the-art skin lesion classifiers. Unfortunately, it is difficult to compare different classification methods because some approaches use nonpublic datasets for training and/or testing, thereby making reproducibility difficult. Future publications should use publicly available benchmarks and fully disclose methods used for training to allow comparability.},

  abstract = {1. The after-effects of repetitive stimulation of the perforant path fibres to the dentate area of the hippocampal formation have been examined with extracellular micro-electrodes in rabbits anaesthetized with urethane. 2. In fifteen out of eighteen rabbits the population response recorded from granule cells in the dentate area to single perforant path volleys was potentiated for periods ranging from 30 min to 10 hr after one or more conditioning trains at 10\textendash 20/sec for 10\textendash 15 sec, or 100/sec for 3\textendash 4 sec. 3. The population response was analysed in terms of three parameters: the amplitude of the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.), signalling the depolarization of the granule cells, and the amplitude and latency of the population spike, signalling the discharge of the granule cells. 4. All three parameters were potentiated in 29\% of the experiments; in other experiments in which long term changes occurred, potentiation was confined to one or two of the three parameters. A reduction in the latency of the population spike was the commonest sign of potentiation, occurring in 57\% of all experiments. The amplitude of the population e.p.s.p. was increased in 43\%, and of the population spike in 40\%, of all experiments. 5. During conditioning at 10\textendash 20/sec there was massive potentiation of the population spike (`frequency potentiation'). The spike was suppressed during stimulation at 100/sec. Both frequencies produced long-term potentiation. 6. The results suggest that two independent mechanisms are responsible for long-lasting potentiation: (a) an increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission at the perforant path synapses; (b) an increase in the excitability of the granule cell population.},

Doctor AI is a temporal model using recurrent neural networks (RNN) and was developed and applied to longitudinal time stamped EHR data from 260K patients and 2,128 physicians over 8 years. Encounter records (e.g. diagnosis codes, medication codes or procedure codes) were input to RNN to predict (all) the diagnosis and medication categories for a subsequent visit. Doctor AI assesses the history of patients to make multilabel predictions (one label for each diagnosis or medication category). Based on separate blind test set evaluation, Doctor AI can perform differential diagnosis with up to 79\% recall@30, significantly higher than several baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate great generalizability of Doctor AI by adapting the resulting models from one institution to another without losing substantial accuracy.}

During development both normal and supernumerary optic tracts terminated within a single, previously uninnervated tectal lobe. Autoradiographic tracing of either the normal or supernumerary eye's projection revealed distinct, eye-specific bands of radioactivity running rostrocaudally through the dually innervated tectum. Interactions among axons of retinal ganglion cells, possibly mediated through tectal neurons, must be invoked to explain this stereotyped disruption of the normally continuous retinal termination pattern.},

Hebb's life, and the scientific milieu in psychology and neurophysiology which preceded and informed Hebb's work are described. His core postulate, which gave rise to such eponymous expressions as the Hebbian synapse and the Hebbian learning rule, is examined in some detail, as well as the part it played in his higher-order theoretical constructs concerned with neocortical structure and function. Early models which made use of the Hebbian synapse are described, and then illustrative examples are given detailing the impact of Hebb's idea in relation to learning and memory, synaptic plasticity and stability, and the question of persistent cortical activity underlying forms of short-term memory.},

Da diese Hardware bestenfalls in Ans\"atzen existiert, werden die meisten Modelle, von denen die Rede sein wird, auf konventionellen Computern simuliert. Die Idee der neuronalen Netzwerke ist die folgende:Die Informationsverarbeitung geschieht durch eine gro\ss e Anzahl von relativ einfachen Prozessoren, die in einem dichten Netzwerk miteinander verbunden sind. Diese Prozessoren (auch Units genannt1) arbeiten lokal, jeder fir sich allein, und kommunizieren mit anderen Units nur via Signale, die sie \"uber die Verbindungen senden.Schematisch ist das in Abb. 2.1 dargestellt.

Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being designed routinely and moving toward successful applications. The structures of small proteins are now often well predicted by computer methods. And, there is now a testable explanation for how a protein can fold so quickly: A protein solves its large global optimization problem as a series of smaller local optimization problems, growing and assembling the native structure from peptide fragments, local structures first.},

The fracture behaviour is studied by means of the Essential Work of Fracture (EWF) procedure, and is complemented by the study of the effect of thermal treatment on tensile properties and microstructure, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). It is shown that the initial metastable phase of quenched iPP films, widely known as smectic, transforms gradually into the monoclinic form as the annealing temperature is increased, resulting in an important improvement of the tensile properties, whereas the fracture parameters have different evolutions depending on the ethylene content. The reasons for a decrease in the essential work term and an increase in the plastic term as the crystal perfection grows are discussed on the basis of the microstructural changes of the crystalline phase and the smectic\textendash monoclinic strain-induced phase transformation.},

As the first national, large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) research and development (R\&amp;D) project to be free from military influence and corporate profit motives, the FGCS was open, international, and oriented around public goods. Although the FGCS did not plan any commercialized technologies, many American computer experts portrayed it as an economic threat to U.S. dominance in computing and the global economy\textemdash and policymakers around the developed world believed them and funded AI projects of their own. Later, however, the FGCS was remembered as a failure. Why? This article recasts the FGCS as an interstice in the shift from a state-funded regime of American science organization to the neoliberal privatized regime of R\&amp;D now ascendant around the world. By exploring how notions of economic competitiveness and national security shaped R\&amp;D, this article reveals AI to be a product of contingent choices by multiple actors\textemdash nation-states, government bureaucracies, corporations, and individuals\textemdash rather than the outcome of deterministic technological forces.}

II the effects of cooling velocity (velocities 0.4, 0.7 and 2.0 \textdegree C/s) and the type of skin area stimulated (hairy or glabrous skin of the hand) on the thresholds of paradoxical sensations were studied in 4 Ss without and with preheating. Cooling velocity, type of skin area and preheatting had significant effects on the sensation thresholds, the thresholds being the higher (i.e. the sensation appearing at lower stimulation temperatures) the higher the cooling velocity, if the stimuli were applied to the glabrous skin, or if no preheating was used. The results confirm the existence of paradoxical heat sensations during cooling of the skin and suggest that thesensation is mediated by polymodal units supplied by C-fibers.},

  abstract = {Examples of neural networks in different areas in medicine Summary. In daily clinical practice, the ophthalmologist is permanently expected to give statements about the prognosis of a disease as well as the optimal course of therapy. In order to do so, the eye specialist combines his expert knowledge as well as historical information to provide the most accurate prognosis possible. Neural networks can be trained and optimized based on already known courses of the disease that are based on large samples of patients, and to combine in a similar way recent as well as historical data. It is the objective of this manuscript to give a short introduction of this concept, a brief summary of the historical development, an illustration of neural networks as they are applied in different areas in medicine and to discuss important features of neural network models. Examples of published studies within ophthalmology (rates for detection of vessels, identification of patients with diabetic retinopathy with neural nets), internal medicine (prognosis of pulmonary embolism; prognosis whether a patient can successfully be weaned from respiratory support), urology (prostatic carcinoma) and neural nets for early melanoma diagnosis are mentioned. Important advantages and disadvantages of expert systems based on neural networks will be discussed and users are cautioned for possible misuse of such models.},

Klassische Transmitter sind Acetylcholin, die Aminos\"aure Glutamat und die Monoamine Noradrenalin und Gamma-Aminobutters\"aure (GABA). Damit es nach Transmitterfreisetzung nicht zur dauerhaften synaptischen \"Ubertragung kommt, muss der freigesetzte Transmitter wieder aus dem synaptischen Spalt entfernt werden. Dies geschieht, je nach Transmitter, durch aktive und passive Prozesse. So wird Acetylcholin durch die Cholinesterase gespalten, w\"ahrend im ZNS Glutamat aus dem synaptischen Spalt diffundiert und von Gliazellen aufgenommen wird. F\"ur die Wirkung des Transmitters sind die Typen postsynaptischer Rezeptoren entscheidend. So wirkt Acetylcholin erregend an der motorischen Endplatte, aber hemmend an den Schrittmacherzellen des Herzens. Die synaptische \"Ubertragung kann durch Molek\"ule moduliert werden, die die Synapse verst\"arken (Agonisten) oder abschw\"achen (Antagonisten).},

Through an enormous experimental effort1\textendash 4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence\textemdash the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8\textemdash has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10\textendash 14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Here, we will examine how applying this Hebbian learning rule to a system of interconnected neurons in the presence of direct or indirect re-afference (e.g. seeing/hearing one's own actions) predicts the emergence of mirror neurons with predictive properties. In this framework, we analyse how mirror neurons become a dynamic system that performs active inferences about the actions of others and allows joint actions despite sensorimotor delays. We explore how this system performs a projection of the self onto others, with egocentric biases to contribute to mind-reading. Finally, we argue that Hebbian learning predicts mirror-like neurons for sensations and emotions and review evidence for the presence of such vicarious activations outside the motor system.}

  abstract = {Discusses the influence of Donald Olding Hebb (1904\textendash 1985) on the discipline of psychology. The author notes that Hebb's principled opposition to radical behaviourism and emphasis on understanding what goes on between stimulus and response (perception, learning, thinking) helped clear the way for the cognitive revolution. His view of psychology as a biological science and his neuropsychological cell-assembly proposal rejuvenated interest in physiological psychology. Since his death, Hebb's seminal ideas exert an ever-growing influence on those interested in mind (cognitive science), brain (neuroscience), and how brains implement mind (cognitive neuroscience). Specific events in Hebb's career are outlined, with particular attention to the influence on psychology of his book The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory (1949).

Here, we outline a development that might eventually lead to a neurobiologically grounded theory of cortical associative memory.}

Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.}

This paper introduces G-Net, a sequential deep learning framework for counterfactual prediction under dynamic time-varying treatment strategies in complex longitudinal settings. G-Net is based upon g-computation, a causal inference method for estimating effects of general dynamic treatment strategies. Past g-computation implementations have mostly been built using classical regression models. G-Net instead adopts a recurrent neural network framework to capture complex temporal and nonlinear dependencies in the data. To our knowledge, G-Net is the first g-computation based deep sequential modeling framework that provides estimates of treatment effects under \textbackslash emdynamic and \textbackslash emtime-varying treatment strategies. We evaluate G-Net using simulated longitudinal data from two sources: CVSim, a mechanistic model of the cardiovascular system, and a pharmacokinetic simulation of tumor growth. G-Net outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art counterfactual prediction models in these settings.}

These connections develop after birth and attain their specificity by pruning. To test whether there is selective stabilization of connections between those cells that exhibit correlated activity, kittens were raised with artificially induced strabismus (eye deviation) to eliminate the correlation between signals from the two eyes. In area 17, cell clusters were driven almost exclusively from either the right or the left eye and tangential intracortical fibers preferentially connected cell groups activated by the same eye. Thus, circuit selection depends on visual experience, and the selection criterion is the correlation of activity.}

Through two examples, prostate cancer identification in biopsy specimens and breast cancer metastasis detection in sentinel lymph nodes, we show the potential of this new methodology to reduce the workload for pathologists, while at the same time increasing objectivity of diagnoses. We found that all slides containing prostate cancer and micro- and macro-metastases of breast cancer could be identified automatically while 30\textendash 40\% of the slides containing benign and normal tissue could be excluded without the use of any additional immunohistochemical markers or human intervention.

He became a serious student of mathematical logic, and investigated the mathematico-logical aspects of schizophrenia and psychopathia while serving at the Rockland Hospital for the Insane.

And I said, ``I don't know.'' ``And what is thee going to do?'' And again I said ``I have no idea; but there is one question I would like to answer: What is a number, that a man may know it, and a man, that he may know a number?''

  abstract = {In recent years, several studies have provided insight on the functioning of the brain which consists of neurons and form networks via interconnection among them by synapses. Neural networks are formed by interconnected systems of neurons, and are of two types, namely, the Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) and Biological Neural Network (interconnected nerve cells). The ANNs are computationally influenced by human neurons and are used in modelling neural systems. The reasoning foundations of ANNs have been useful in anomaly detection, in areas of medicine such as instant physician, electronic noses, pattern recognition, and modelling biological systems. Advancing research in artificial intelligence using the architecture of the human brain seeks to model systems by studying the brain rather than looking to technology for brain models. This study explores the concept of ANNs as a simulator of the biological neuron, and its area of applications. It also explores why brain-like intelligence is needed and how it differs from computational framework by comparing neural networks to contemporary computers and their modern day implementation.},

I devote particular attention to the proofs and arguments of Minsky and Papert, which were interpreted as showing that further progress in neural nets was not possible, and that this approach to AI had to be abandoned. I maintain that this official interpretation of the debate was a result of the emergence, institutionalization and (importantly) legitimation of the symbolic AI approach (with its resource allocation system and authority structure). At the `research-area' level, there was considerable interpretative flexibility. This interpretative flexibility was further demonstrated by the revival of neural nets in the late 1980s, and subsequent rewriting of the official history of the debate.},

Both are independent of small perturbations at synapses of excitation, threshold, and synchrony, and are referred to partiular appropriate regions of the nervous system, thus suggesting experimental verification. The first mechanism averages an apparition over a group, and in the treatment of this mechanism it is suggested that scansion plays a significant part. The second mechanism reduces an apparition to a standard selected from among its many legitimate presentations. The former mechanism is exemplified by the recognition of chords regardless of pitch and shapes regardless of size. The latter is exemplified here only in the reflexive mechanism translating apparitions to the fovea. Both are extensions to contemporaneous functions of the knowing of universals heretofore treated by the authors only with respect to sequence in time.}

The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden' units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.}

  abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)\textemdash a blind assessment of the state of the field\textemdash AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.},

Although, there are many different forms of Hebb's postulate, I believe that essentially all ``viable'' mammalian cortical models embody some version of his idea: ``Let us assume then that the persistence or repetition of a reverberatory activity (or ``trace'') tends to induce lasting cellular changes that add to its stability. The assumption can be precisely stated as follows:When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A `s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased''.},

  abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses `value networks' to evaluate board positions and `policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.}

Zu dieser Zeit gab es die Informatik wie in der heutigen Form noch nicht. Darum waren es keine Informatiker, die die Forschung um Neuronale Netze initialisierten, sondern Psychologen. In diesem Kapitel wird mit einem kompakten historischen Abriss gestartet. Alles begann mit dem sogenannten Perceptron, welches bereits erstaunliche approximative F\"ahigkeiten besa\ss{} und eine Disziplin innerhalb der k\"unstlichen Intelligenzforschung bildete. 1970, ausgel\"ost durch den sogenannten Lighthill Report erfuhr die KI-Forschung einen D\"ampfer, welcher den KI-Winter einl\"autete. Jeder Winter wird vom Fr\"uhling verdr\"angt, so auch hier. Mehr- bzw. tiefschichtige Netze (Deep Neural Networks) bilden heute den Status quo. Nach diesem historischen Abriss, der entscheidend zum Verst\"andnis dieser toller Disziplin ist, wird das Kapitel weitergef\"uhrt, indem ein paar unterschiedliche Lern- bzw. Trainingsverfahren Neuronaler Netze vorgestellt werden. Den Abschluss dieses Kapitels bildet ein Unterkapitel \"uber besonders erw\"ahnenswerte Netzwerktypen sowie ihre m\"oglichen Einsatzgebiete. In diesem Kapitel werden noch einmal wichtige Fachbegriffe er\"ortert und den einzelnen Netzwerktypen zugeordnet.},

  abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been extensively used in a range of medical fields to promote therapeutic development. The development of diverse AI techniques has also contributed to early detections, disease diagnoses, and referral management. However, concerns about the value of advanced AI in disease diagnosis have been raised by health care professionals, medical service providers, and health policy decision makers. Objective: This review aimed to systematically examine the literature, in particular, focusing on the performance comparison between advanced AI and human clinicians to provide an up-to-date summary regarding the extent of the application of AI to disease diagnoses. By doing so, this review discussed the relationship between the current advanced AI development and clinicians with respect to disease diagnosis and thus therapeutic development in the long run. Methods: We systematically searched articles published between January 2000 and March 2019 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis in the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. According to the preset inclusion and exclusion criteria, only articles comparing the medical performance between advanced AI and human experts were considered. Results: A total of 9 articles were identified. A convolutional neural network was the commonly applied advanced AI technology. Owing to the variation in medical fields, there is a distinction between individual studies in terms of classification, labeling, training process, dataset size, and algorithm validation of AI. Performance indices reported in articles included diagnostic accuracy, weighted errors, false-positive rate, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results showed that the performance of AI was at par with that of clinicians and exceeded that of clinicians with less experience. Conclusions: Current AI development has a diagnostic performance that is comparable with medical experts, especially in image recognition-related fields. Further studies can be extended to other types of medical imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and other medical practices unrelated to images. With the continued development of AI-assisted technologies, the clinical implications underpinned by clinicians' experience and guided by patient-centered health care principle should be constantly considered in future AI-related and other technology-based medical research.},

The results indicate that physicians are accepting of applications that enhance their patient management capabilities, but tend to oppose applications in which they perceive an infringement on their management role. Expectations about the effect of computing on current medical practices are found to be generally favorable, although considerable individual differences exist among subgroups. The study participants place substantial demands on the performance capabilities of acceptable consultation systems, and emphasize the need for humanlike interactive capabilities. The tutorial had no effect on attitudes regarding appropriate clinical uses of computers nor on expectations about the effect of the technology on medical practice. However, it did increase the participants' knowledge of medical computing and led to more informed demands on system performance. We discuss the implications of the study and offer suggestions for developing and implementing computer-based clinical decision aids.}

Listening to the voices, coming from the cardiac valves via stethoscope, upon the flow of the blood running in the heart, physicians examine whether there is any abnormality with regard to the heart. However, listening via stethoscope has got a number of limitations, for interpreting different heart sounds depends on hearing ability, experience, and respective skill of the physician. Such limitations may be reduced by developing biomedical based decision support systems. In this study, a biomedical-based decision support system was developed for the classification of heart sound signals, obtained from 120 subjects with normal, pulmonary and mitral stenosis heart valve diseases via stethoscope. Developed system was mainly comprised of three stages, namely as being feature extraction, dimension reduction, and classification. At feature extraction stage, applying Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Burg autoregressive (AR) spectrum analysis method, features, representing heart sounds in frequency domain, were obtained. Obtained features were reduced in lower dimensions via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), being used as a dimension reduction technique. Heart sounds were classified by having the features applied as input to Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Classification results have shown that, dimension reduction, being conducted via PCA, has got positive effects on the classification of the heart sounds.}

  abstract = {Many researchers believe sleep helps us consolidate our memories, but no one knows quite how. Yang et al. investigated the precise role of sleep in changing mouse brain structures (see the Perspective by Euston and Steenland). When mice learned motor tasks, small protuberances\textemdash or ``spines''\textemdash formed on some of the dendritic branches of specific brain neurons. These spines represent the physical correlate of a memory. But the neurons grew and retained these spines better when the mice slept after learning the task. Neurons that fired during learning fired again during subsequent slow-wave sleep, allowing the mice to conserve the newly formed spines\textemdash and memories. Science, this issue p. 1173; see also p. 1087 In mice, synaptic connectivity changes after motor learning are influenced by sleep. [Also see Perspective by Euston and Steenland] How sleep helps learning and memory remains unknown. We report in mouse motor cortex that sleep after motor learning promotes the formation of postsynaptic dendritic spines on a subset of branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons. New spines are formed on different sets of dendritic branches in response to different learning tasks and are protected from being eliminated when multiple tasks are learned. Neurons activated during learning of a motor task are reactivated during subsequent non\textendash rapid eye movement sleep, and disrupting this neuronal reactivation prevents branch-specific spine formation. These findings indicate that sleep has a key role in promoting learning-dependent synapse formation and maintenance on selected dendritic branches, which contribute to memory storage.},

  abstract = {Scene parsing is challenging for unrestricted open vocabulary and diverse scenes. In this paper, we exploit the capability of global context information by different-region-based context aggregation through our pyramid pooling module together with the proposed pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet). Our global prior representation is effective to produce good quality results on the scene parsing task, while PSPNet provides a superior framework for pixel-level prediction. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets. It came first in ImageNet scene parsing challenge 2016, PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark and Cityscapes benchmark. A single PSPNet yields the new record of mIoU accuracy 85.4\% on PASCAL VOC 2012 and accuracy 80.2\% on Cityscapes.},
